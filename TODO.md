Ideas
Navigation Guards - certain pages reject navigation, try later as using authentication it's a bit more complicated

Use transactions for manipulating the data in the inventory
addToScore(userId, score){

Transitions - use when moving or things are added to notifications, also check out animate.css

Make ProfilePage update all values right away when new account

Vuefire to make updates to firebase as soon as changes are made in the modal

sendSignInLinkToEmail - Change entire way of creating new accounts

Send notify when profile image changed


TODO FROM CLASS
- Image compression


Permission control over page navigation instead of just hiding
focus on first in modal

Better controls on roles permissions, not just not showing buttons

Clear fab add item on submit
sort categories first
